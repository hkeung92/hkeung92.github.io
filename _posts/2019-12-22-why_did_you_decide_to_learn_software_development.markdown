I studied economics and finance in college. It was fun to study, but when it comes to job's market. I found it is way more complicated than I thought. I need to study many extra stuff to get a certificate which pushes me away, as those materials are totally different from what I studied at school. After I landed a finance job, it was interesting in the beginning as everything was new to me. However, my feeling changed since I was repeating everything every day. There is no challenge at all. The duties and workloads have never changed, which were quite boring and not convincing. Therefore, I did research for software development as I also studied a bit in college and my friend who is working in Oracle also highly recommended me.
