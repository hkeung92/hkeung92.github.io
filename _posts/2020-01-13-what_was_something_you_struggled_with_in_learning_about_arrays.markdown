There are many different stuggles in this journey actually. It is always not easy to learn coding. In order to become a good programmer, I must master at least one of the programming languages. I will never forget the reason why I choose to make a change and this decision. No matter how hard or tough, I must overcome it. While the others may need to spend 8 hours a day, I am dedicated and willing to spend 12 hours per day. 
For the struggles in array, sometimes it is hard to distinguish where I should add an array unless there is a clear instruction about it. It seemed easy when I first learnt this. I thought it was simply an array to put something inside. However, it is not. As far as I understand, it is used to make an access to a list of strings. There are many different methods to manage an array, such as adding, removing, rearranging, sorting, or even choosing elements from it specifically afterwards. It is always fun to learn a new thing, but when it comes to more advanced, it is a lot harder than I thought. When I need to access the array, I need to specify with certain code. For instance, [0], [1], [-1], last, etc are some kinds of locator that I need to use when I want to find it. Moreover, there are also another kinds of enumerators such as “any?”, “none?”, “all?”, “include?”. These are useful enumerators that we need to use often.
